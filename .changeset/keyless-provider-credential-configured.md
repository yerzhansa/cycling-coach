User-facing: Setup now remembers the Claude subscription lane instead of showing Anthropic when you reopen it.

`credential_configured` was derived from a non-empty `llm.api_key` for every provider except `openai-codex`, so the keyless lanes that never write a key — `claude-cli` and `codex-agent` — were structurally false forever. That nulled the onboarding wizard's active provider, and the Setup draft then fell through to the first entry in the provider catalogue. The runtime check now short-circuits on `isKeylessProvider` and only falls through to the key-length test for providers that actually hold a key. The `openai-codex` branch stays ahead of that short-circuit, so the ChatGPT lane still depends on a stored auth profile rather than reporting itself configured with nothing on disk.

Populating the active provider exposed a latent assumption in the Settings coach panel: it treated an active provider that is absent from the public model catalogue as an unloadable configuration. `codex-agent` is deliberately absent from the catalogue, so that path became reachable for the first time and would have left those athletes on a dead error screen with no way to switch away. The panel now loads with the provider list intact and no draft selection, and the coach route row reads the active provider off the runtime snapshot instead of the draft, so it no longer reports "Not configured" for a provider that is actually serving turns. An empty catalogue is still a genuine load error.
